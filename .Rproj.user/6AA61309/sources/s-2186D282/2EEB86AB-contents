# Biology 205 R Tutorial
Welcome to the BIOL 205 R Studio lab assignment! Let's go through a few things to get you started:

Introduction:

R is an invaluable tool in analyzing data that can be used for research, publication, as well as class work, and this is presumably your first exposure to such a useful program. For this assignment, we're going to walk you through step by step how to complete the project and use trips/tricks to get the data exactly how you want it to look. 

Accessing the tutorial and project:

Make sure you have R Studio open, then navigate back to this page. Click the green "clone or download button", and download the zip file. This should be found in your download folder on the computer, of which you can drag the files into the designated location of your preference. In R Studio, find this file in the lower right hand corner under "files", and select "Rscript dochomeument.R". This will load in the tutorial, which will then have directions to help you load in all the data you need, and successfully complete the assignment! Have fun!

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

This is an R Markdown, which means that the code itself goes in the grey boxes below. Let's try to add a new code section: click in line 18, then add a new chunk via Insert --> R . 



The green arrow in the right hand corner runs the code in the grey box. Try running a summary of the Cars data set below.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

Cars is an embedded data set that you can explore at another time, for now let's keep going.

## Including Plots

This is howe we can plot certain factors, go ahead and press the green arrow in the upper right hand corner:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Now that we know some basic R markdown functions, we will move onto BIOL205 data. Let's walk through importing data from Excel.

In the upper left hand corner --> File --> Import Dataset --> Import from Excel --> Browse, and look for your Excel file.

If done correctly, once you "import" your file, it should appear in your environment tab in the upper right panel. It should also automatically open in a separate tab next to this tab (upper left hand corner of R Studio).

Another way to import an Excel spreadsheet is via code. Make sure the excel file you're looking for is located in the same directory (folder) as this file:

```{r 1}
library(readxl)
For205Tutorial <- read_excel("For205Tutorial.xlsx")
print(For205Tutorial)
```

Once imported, confirm that the data values are the same as when they were in Excel. 

```{r 2}
print(For205Tutorial)
```

If you want to view your data at any time, you can either select the tab above or create a chunk with the code shown above. Capitilization is very important so make sure the code is written with puncutation/capitalization, or it will not work.

Now we're going to show you how to plot your data, via a scatterplot to create a standard curve.

First, you'll have to install ggplot2. When installing packages, the package title must be in single quotes, as below. Go ahead and run this code chunk:

```{r 3}
install.packages('ggplot2')
```

Notice there is red text; sometimes red texts means there is an error, other times it is not. For this specific situation, this red text is good! It means our package worked and downloaded properly.

Once you install the package you need, you have to activate the package, via running the code chunk below.

```{r 4}
library(ggplot2)
```

Great!

Now, let's try a basic scatterplot. The first code line: ggplot(For205Tutorial) is describing what graphing package we're using, and also what dataset we are using
The second code line "aes(For205Tutorial$`Protein conc. (mg/mL`), For205Tutorial$`Absorbance (at 595nm)`)" details the x and y axis, respectively, from that data set. We have to tell R Studio what data set we're using for each axis, and the $ sign denotes which column the data is coming from. 
The third code line is telling R Studio what type of graph we want; specifically we want a point plot, or scatterplot. 

```{r 5}
ggplot(For205Tutorial) +
  aes(For205Tutorial$`Protein conc. (mg/mL)`, For205Tutorial$`Absorbance (at 595 nm)`) +
  geom_point()
```

This is a good start, but we need to change the axis labels; let's copy and paste the above code into another grey chunk. 

```{r 6}
ggplot(For205Tutorial) +
  aes(For205Tutorial$`Protein conc. (mg/mL)`, For205Tutorial$`Absorbance (at 595 nm)`) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Protein conc. (mg/mL)") +
  ylab("Absorbance (595 mm)")
```

So we changed the axis by using the functions "xlab" and "ylab", then telling R what we want our labels to be called. It's important to match each parenthesis. Next, we want to clean up the graph, getting rid of the grey background and the gridlines (remember, we're trying to produce a graph that can be published in a scientific journal).

```{r 7}
ggplot(For205Tutorial) +
  aes(For205Tutorial$`Protein conc. (mg/mL)`, For205Tutorial$`Absorbance (at 595 nm)`) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Protein conc. (mg/mL)") +
  ylab("Absorbance (595 mm)") +
  theme_bw() + theme(panel.border = element_blank(), panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"), axis.text = element_text(color="black"))
```

We have a nice looking graph, so let's add the regression line with "geom_smooth(method=lm, se = FALSE, color="black")." This will allow a linear trendline.

```{r 8}
ggplot(For205Tutorial) +
  aes(For205Tutorial$`Protein conc. (mg/mL)`, For205Tutorial$`Absorbance (at 595 nm)`) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Protein conc. (mg/mL)") +
  ylab("Absorbance (595 mm)") +
  theme_bw() + theme(panel.border = element_blank(), panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"), axis.text = element_text(color="black")) +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, se = FALSE, color="black")
```

So great, we have a line for the standards. But what is that line? We can actually take a look at the equation of the line by using the lm function. Below you can see the lm() function, with our x and y in the parentheses, separated with a squiggly: lm(x ~ y). The left arrow then assigns this function to a variable called "lm1". (You might actually see this variable pop up in the "Environment" tab of the upper right panel.) We can do several things to this variable, such as simply printing it:

```{r 9}
lm1 <- lm(For205Tutorial$`Protein conc. (mg/mL)` ~ For205Tutorial$`Absorbance (at 595 nm)`)
print(lm1)
```

Under coefficients we can find the y-intercept (-0.1665) as well as the slope (1.1052). Putting this together we get the following equation: 
y = 1.1052x + -0.1665 , when x is the protein concentration and y is the absorbance. Let's try to put this equation on our plot:

```{r 10}
ggplot(For205Tutorial) +
  aes(For205Tutorial$`Protein conc. (mg/mL)`, For205Tutorial$`Absorbance (at 595 nm)`) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Protein conc. (mg/mL)") +
  ylab("Absorbance (595 mm)") +
  theme_bw() + theme(panel.border = element_blank(), panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"), axis.text = element_text(color="black")) +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, se = FALSE, color="black") +
  geom_text(x = 0.4, y=0.9, label="y = 1.105x + -0.1665")
```

Cool. But this isn't all we want to do. Let's say we measure an unknown sample and get the following absorbance value:
We know y (absorbance) but we are looking for x (concentration). Rearranging the equation gives: x = (y + 0.1665)/1.1052. We can actually make this into a new variable.

```{r 11}
y1 = 0.5
x1 <- (y1 + 0.1665)/1.1052
print(x1)
```

Let's break down the above chunk. First we told them what our unknown y concentration is. The next line defines a new variable, x, from the equation of the line that we found up in chunk 9. The last line of code then prints our x variable: 0.603 mg/mL. We can ignore that bracketed number in our output. 

But, why did we label the y and x with a 1? That's so we can look at more unknowns. To do so, all you need to do is copy chunk 11 and change the "x1"s to "x2"s and so on. If you noticed, the x's and y's you make will appear in the Environment tab. 






```{r attempting to make the line calculate and print on graph, probably won't need this and doesn't work perfectly}
c <- For205Tutorial$`Absorbance (at 595 nm)`
d <- For205Tutorial$`Protein conc. (mg/mL)`
m <- lm(d ~ c, For205Tutorial)
lm_eqn <- function(For205Tutorial){
eq <- substitute(italic(y) == a + b %.% italic(x)*","~~italic(r)^2~"="~r2, list(a = format(coef(m)[1], digits = 4), b = format(coef(m)[2], digits = 4), r2 = format(summary(m)$r.squared, digits = 3)))
as.character(as.expression(eq));
}
ggplot(For205Tutorial) +
  aes(For205Tutorial$`Protein conc. (mg/mL)`, For205Tutorial$`Absorbance (at 595 nm)`) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Protein conc. (mg/mL)") +
  ylab("Absorbance (595 mm)") +
  theme_bw() + theme(panel.border = element_blank(), panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"), axis.text = element_text(color="black")) +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, se = FALSE, color="black") +
  geom_text(x = 0.4, y = 0.9, label = lm_eqn(For205Tutorial), parse = TRUE)
```


**Helpful tips for using R**
  - You never need to learn how to code! Just copy and paste code chunks that seem to work, and change things to fit your data and/or analysis.
  - Each code chunk has a {r} at the top. You can write useful titles to your chunks within these brackets, i.e. {r Cool Plot 3}, but if you add a title, make sure each chunk is different!
  - You can also include the R-squared value on your plot if you want. Try using "summary(lm1)" to locate the R-squared and see if you can alter chunk 10 to add that to the plot (exclude the quotations when using the summary function).

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

This is an R Markdown, which means that the code itself goes in the grey boxes below. You can add a new chunk via Insert --> R . Let's try that now:

```{r}

```

The green arrow in the right hand corner runs the code in the grey box. Try running the Cars data set below.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

Cars is an embedded data set that you can explore at another time, for now let's keep going.

## Including Plots

This is howe we can plot certain factors, go ahead and press the green arrow in the upper right hand corner:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Now that we know some basic R markdown functions, we will move onto BIOL205 data. Let's walk through importing data from Excel.

In the upper right hand corner --> File --> Import Dataset --> Import from Excel --> Browse, and look for your Excel file.

If done correctly, once you "import" your file, it should appear in your environment tab in the upper right hand corner. It should also automatically open in a separate panel next to this panel (upper left hand corner of R Studio).

Another way to import an Excel spreadsheet is via code. Make sure the excel file you're looking for is located in the same directory as this file:

```{r}
library(readxl)
For205Tutorial <- read_excel("For205Tutorial.xlsx")
print(For205Tutorial)
```

Once imported, confirm that the data values are the same as when they were in Excel. 

```{r}
print(For205Tutorial)
```

If you want to view your data at any time, you can either select the tab above or create a chunk with the code shown above. Capitilization is very important so make sure the code is written with puncutation/capitalization, or it will not work.

Now we're going to show you how to plot your data, via a scatterplot to create a standard curve.

First, you'll have to install ggplot2, when installing packages, the package title must be in single quotes, as below. Go ahead and run this code chunk:

```{r}
install.packages('ggplot2')
```

Notice there is red text; sometimes red texts means there is an error, other times it is not. For this specific situation, this red text is good! It means our package worked and downloaded properly.

Once you install the package you need, you have to activate the package, via running the code chunk below.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

Great!

Now, let's try a basic scatterplot. The first code line: ggplot(For205Tutorial) is describing what graphing package we're using, and also what dataset we are using
The second code line aes(For205Tutorial$`Protein conc. (mg/mL`), For205Tutorial$`Absorbance (at 595nm)`) is the x and y axis, respectively, from that data set. We have to tell R Studio what data set we're using for each axis, and the $ sign denotes which column the data is coming from. 
The third code line is telling R Studio what type of graph we want; specifically we want a point plot, or scatterplot. 

```{r}
ggplot(For205Tutorial) +
  aes(For205Tutorial$`Protein conc. (mg/mL)`, For205Tutorial$`Absorbance (at 595 nm)`) +
  geom_point()
```

This is a good start, but we need to change the axis labels; let's copy and paste the above code into another grey chunk. 

```{r}
ggplot(For205Tutorial) +
  aes(For205Tutorial$`Protein conc. (mg/mL)`, For205Tutorial$`Absorbance (at 595 nm)`) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Protein conc. (mg/mL)") +
  ylab("Absorbance (595 mm)")
```

So we changed the axis by using the functions "xlab" and "ylab", then telling R what we want our labels to be called. It's important to match each parenthesis. Next, we want to clean up the lines (remember, we're trying to produce a graph that can be published in a scientific journal)

```{r}
ggplot(For205Tutorial) +
  aes(For205Tutorial$`Protein conc. (mg/mL)`, For205Tutorial$`Absorbance (at 595 nm)`) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Protein conc. (mg/mL)") +
  ylab("Absorbance (595 mm)") +
  theme_bw() + theme(panel.border = element_blank(), panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"))

```
